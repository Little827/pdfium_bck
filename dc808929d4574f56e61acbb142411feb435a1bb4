      "message": "hnakashima@, I would agree generally that taking the click points and doing a move between them works, especially for generating .evt files. The place I found this fine granular logging useful was when I was tracing enter events. I think this is enough a niche case to not be really worth it.\n\nthestig@, I don\u0027t think anyone else uses it, and I agree we could filter it easily. I am thinking of dropping it in general because it is a relatively niche use case.",
