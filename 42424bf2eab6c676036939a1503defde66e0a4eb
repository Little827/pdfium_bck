      "message": "Homogenizing the behaviour between xfa and non-xfa cases. I should mention that the overarching goal is to is to someday get to a runtime toggle between xfa and non-xfa, where the \"built with xfa but running without it\" behaves the same as the baseline \"built without xfa\".  In this case, I don\u0027t think we ever hit the bad object path in practice, but it isn\u0027t possible in the non-xfa case, and I didn\u0027t want that to change just because XFA is enabled at build time.",
