      "message": "I thought about that, but decided that part of the problem with this code might be that it is probing at the dictionary directly rather than using CPDF_Action methods to get the same information. For example, actionfields code shouldn\u0027t know that a particular value is bound to a /T key, for instance -- action should abstract that.  So I moved the dictionary code to action itself.\n\nfoo_ : done.",
