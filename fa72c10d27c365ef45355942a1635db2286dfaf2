This CL is allow to us store original object without modifications.\nSee https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/pdfium/core/fpdfapi/edit/cpdf_creator.cpp?rcl\u003d774c90d5ec92d2c58d821c445230d8cb71928dcb\u0026l\u003d749\n\nOn the good, we should not change it within CPDF_Creator, at the time of saving. We should use the copy instead.\n\nI will solve this later.\nFor now, i have created copy within CPDF_Parser.\n\n2) The trailer within CPDF_CrossRefTable(on which i want migrate) is not guarantee, that object will not be destroyed, in process of trailers merging.",

      "message": "For (1), yes, I see CPDF_Creator can modify the encryption dictionary. I don\u0027t understand the \"On the good, ...\" sentence though. Are you trying to say CPDF_Creator should have its own copy?\n\nFor (2), are you saying CPDF_CrossRefTable objects may get destroyed during MergeUp() calls? Therefore you don\u0027t want |m_pEncryptDict| to potentially point to an destroyed object? Is that the primary motivation for this CL?",
