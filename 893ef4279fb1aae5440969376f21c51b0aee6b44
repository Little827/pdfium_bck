For rectangles.pdf, I have to zoom in and look very carefully to see the difference. Here, the differences are noticeable even in the thumbnails on crbug.com/pdfium/1500. In particular, Skia draws a brighter white dot at every intersection, instead of a gray dot.\n\nI never got a reply here, but looking at https://pdfium-review.googlesource.com/71632, which also involves many_rectangles.pdf, I see this is an artifact from rendering at scale\u003d1. At scale\u003d2, Skia matches AGG. Without path smoothing, Skia also matches Acrobat to the human eye. So I guess this is ok.",
