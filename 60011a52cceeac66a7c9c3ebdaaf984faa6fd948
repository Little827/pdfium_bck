Did the old one represent an Object Number, or was it misleading?\n\nit was misleading. This was not obj num, this was index of shared group.\n\nThe obj nums for shared groups will be parsed in nexts CLs.\nSee https://pdfium-review.googlesource.com/c/pdfium/+/36410/2\n\n\u003e\u003e Anyways, it looks like this represents a range in a file.

Seems like it would be a useful thing to have, no?\n\u003e\u003e Let me know and maybe we can avoid introducing a new type here in favor of a generic mechanism.\n\nHm.. we can try. But can i do this in other CLs, after commiting all planed changes within CPDF_HintTables? \n\n\u003e\u003e If this means something else, then maybe some comments might help?\nYes, this is a range in a file.",
