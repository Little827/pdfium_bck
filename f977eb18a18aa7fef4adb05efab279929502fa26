It seems like \u003cstdint.h\u003e isn\u0027t really used much in PDFium, so I\u0027m going to use fx_system.h system in the files where the former is needed.\n\nBy the way, there was a subtle change to the style-guide recently about includes: the part about not having to include a file already in its identically named header was taken out. I\u0027m not going to mess with the style PDFium is using though.",
