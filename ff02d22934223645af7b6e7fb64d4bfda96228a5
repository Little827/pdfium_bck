      "message": "54.0.2840.0 might not be a good version to test?\nWhen opening the original PDF that came with the bug in 54.0.2840.0, the characters were rendered correctly.\n\nBy changing \"Ordering\" to \"Identity\" and \"Diffenreces\" to \"someunknownname\", Acrobat will stop rendering the character. So far I haven\u0027t found a a combination that could make Acrobat render correctly while 54.0.2840.0 renders incorrectly (still trying on this).",

      "message": "It didn\u0027t render the same for me. Another way to look at it is to sync and build PDFium at commit c559156da and commit 17f4e0268. Given that\u0027s a few years old, doing that build comes with some difficulty. But after doing so, one can see the existing test file renders differently with the 2 commits, while the new one here does not.\n\nTo sanity check, does the user provided PDF from the bug render correctly in Acrobat? Assuming yes, there must be some way to generate a smaller PDF that Acrobat accepts that can replicate the bug.",
