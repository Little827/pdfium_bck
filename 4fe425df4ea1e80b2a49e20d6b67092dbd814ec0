      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is an issue since we use the font box of a character and not the character box itself, but just to be sure: if the character at |index| is a CTRL character (empty box, i.e. height\u003d0), could it crash due to a division by 0?\n\nAlso, what about PDFs with missing or bogus font sizes? In PDFiumPage::GetTextRunInfo(), we calculate an estimated font size to overcome this issue that is set based on some heuristics. I don\u0027t think it should be replicated here (wouldn\u0027t be possible either), but should we add a condition to the if statement to at least make sure we don\u0027t get here when font size is 0?",

Easier to read!\n\nLook at FPDFText_GetCharAngle to have an idea. It would be great if all comments of this file could be like this, but it\u0027s definitely out of the scope of this CL.",
