      "message": "Hi Quinten,\n \nOn PDFium main console[1], a red bot happened but the tree was not automatically closed. I am wondering whether this has anything to do with PDFium not having a tree_closer? (I thought tree_closer was not necessary for the tree to close if I set up luci.notify with \"tree_closing_enabled \u003d True\".)\n\nBut after adding a default tree closer in main.star, I noticed that the generated files didn\u0027t change due to adding the tree closer.\n\nMy questions are:\n1. Is luci.tree_closer optional or mandatory to handle opening/closing the tree?\n2. Maybe the tree didn\u0027t close because this failed bot didn\u0027t meet certain criteria?\n\n[1] https://ci.chromium.org/p/pdfium/g/main/console\n[2] https://ci.chromium.org/p/pdfium/builders/ci/win_xfa_component/2748",
