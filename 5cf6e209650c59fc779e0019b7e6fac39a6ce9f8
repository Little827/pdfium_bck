      "message": "BTW, this is not in alphabetical order. This should have triggered a presubmit failure in your local tree during the \"git cl upload\" process. If that did not happen, then we should discuss why that did not happen. If the presubmit failure appeared and you ignored it, then I would ask you to remember to address the automated complaint in the future instead of ignoring it. Otherwise, all subsequent PDFium CLs get the same presubmit failure and it\u0027s rather annoying. I\u0027ll fix this in https://pdfium-review.googlesource.com/57350 .",

      "message": "Well, I tried to just rearrange this file at ToT, and it turns out that didn\u0027t trigger a presubmit failure. So I\u0027m going to patch that up with https://pdfium-review.googlesource.com/c/pdfium/+/57791.\n\nThe place that does trigger presubmit failures is in public/, where if you rename \"FPDFLink_GetTextRange\" to something else, that should trigger it. You can make a local branch, make this deliberate change, commit it, and then run \"git cl presubmit\" to run the presubmit without uploading. If that doesn\u0027t trigger a failure, then let\u0027s chat offline to figure out what\u0027s wrong with your setup.\n\nA presubmit bot in the CQ is definitely a good idea.
