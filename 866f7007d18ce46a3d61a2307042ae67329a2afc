      "message": "BTW, can we split adding this boolean into its own CL? That should be quick and easy to review. In the new CL, can you name the variable with Google style to \"is_paint_stroke\" ? This file is a weird mixture of Hungarian notation and skiaStyle. I think we should try to just go with 1 style, instead of mixing them.",

I think all this does is hide bugs in the cache.\n\nWith https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/2217eff5, one can now turn on SHOW_SKIA_PATH and get the debug logging code to compile. The debug logging can help show what Skia operations are happening and help spot the bug.",
