      "message": "I won\u0027t push back too much, but I know that moving objects from the stack to the heap isn\u0027t completely free; there\u0027s a small performance hit.\n\nIf you\u0027re worried about the different shapes CFX_FONT take inside CPDF_Font, I would recommend changing more of them to stack allocated objects (if possible). For example, I\u0027m not sure why we bother with a vector of unique_ptrs with `m_FontFallbacks`.\n\nAnother cause for hesitation is that we\u0027re establishing an unenforceable pattern. If we really want to keep CFX_Font objects on the heap (like we\u0027re about to do in  xfa/fde/cfde_textout.cpp for example), we should restrict the access rights of the constructor and instead expose a static factory method.",
