      "message": "BTW, I tried a quick experiment to see if it is easy for PDFium to use //base/allocator instead of //third_party/pdfium/third_party/allocator, when built as part of Chromium. It is not, as PartitionAllocator does not have a stable API and everything has changed. I think it is best to just keep a separate PDFium copy for now, even if it means occasionally paying the cost of doing some porting work.",
