      "message": "I was looking at PDF forms many months ago, but if I remember correctly, I omitted this entry so we can correctly handle malformed PDFs like this one. I had a fix in CPDF_FormField::IsItemSelected() in [1], so maybe I should revive that CL which needs a lot of work. \n\nAlso the /I entry has only been required since PDF 1.4 and we\u0027d want to handle legacy PDFs. I assume the entry was only made required to allow for more efficient reading of forms, but it\u0027s practically redundant with /V. The spec also says that /V takes precedent if its values differ from those of /I, which would require reading both /V and /I. Essentially, I interpret the /I entry as optional if the /V entry is present. \n\n[1] https://pdfium-review.googlesource.com/c/pdfium/+/59190",
