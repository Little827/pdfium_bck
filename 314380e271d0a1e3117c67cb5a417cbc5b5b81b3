      "message": "I need to clean up the CPDF_RenderOptions() code, but I strongly suspect the down sample code will be dead after this. Unless we offer an option in the public API. If we do, I don\u0027t think it will be a popular option. The case that I can think of is when the output bitmap is really big. In which case, downsampling may not look too bad, and the speed-up can be a nice to have.",
