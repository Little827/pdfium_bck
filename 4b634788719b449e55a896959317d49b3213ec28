      "message": "Perhaps we should file and link a Python 3 migration bug for PDFium?\n\nIncidentally, it looks like we just use cStringIO for binary I/O in this file, so this probably should become io.BytesIO in Python 3.\n\nThe \"six\" library can help out with things like this if we want to support both Python 2 and 3. (Chromium already has a copy in third_party/six, we could do the same thing.) At this point, though, maybe we should skip six and convert straight to Python 3; 2*3 support is more useful for modules imported into other programs.",

I think we can get by without adding another one.\n\nOn the other hand, what\u0027s one more? üòä Anyway, maybe we could at least keep this kind of code in a separate \"mini-six\" module of our own, so it\u0027s easy to take out later. (We could replace it with the actual six module if our needs grow.)\n\n\u003e - I\u0027m pretty sure bots still default to Python 2 right now. We can\u0027t convert straight to Python 3.\n\nMy thinking here is that Python 3 is available everywhere now, so as long as we can make sure the scripts run with the correct interpreter (I don\u0027t know if this would be as easy as changing the #! line to reference python3, or in a runner script somewhere, or if it would require more effort), it should be possible in a lot of these cases.\n\nWhere it would be hard would be something like a recipe module that gets pulled into infrastructure code we don\u0027t control the execution of.\n\nAnyway, we probably can pick this discussion up on the bug; I don\u0027t think it blocks any of the current changes.",
