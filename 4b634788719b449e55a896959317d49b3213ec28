      "message": "Perhaps we should file and link a Python 3 migration bug for PDFium?\n\nIncidentally, it looks like we just use cStringIO for binary I/O in this file, so this probably should become io.BytesIO in Python 3.\n\nThe \"six\" library can help out with things like this if we want to support both Python 2 and 3. (Chromium already has a copy in third_party/six, we could do the same thing.) At this point, though, maybe we should skip six and convert straight to Python 3; 2*3 support is more useful for modules imported into other programs.",
