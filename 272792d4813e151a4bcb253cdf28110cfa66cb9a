      "message": "For AGG, CFX_AggDeviceDriver::DrawDeviceText() just returns false, and text drawing takes this code path. There\u0027s a bit of logic here. How much of it should be shared with CFX_SkiaDeviceDriver? Are there parts that are irrelevant? Are there parts that Skia already handle internally?",

      "message": "Instead of passing the text flags as a uint32_t, and then performing a bunch of bitwise operations, you may want to first convert the existing flags into a struct, like we did with struct CPDF_RenderOptions::Options. Then it will be easier to flip/check flags.",

If anti aliasing is disabled, there is not need to set SkFont::Edging::kSubpixelAntiAlias for font anymore.\n\nRight now Skia\u0027s text rendering always enables anti aliasing. A follow-up CL will be chained to set the correct anti-aliasing status depending on |text_flags| and add a embedder test for it.",
