      "message": "The test is comparing bitmap hash before (line 699) and after serialization (line 714). The float serialization is causing pixel level changes. I dumped the PNGs, they don\u0027t visually look different. One possible fix is to add kNonPrimesAfterSaveMD5 and compare against this hash on line 714. The new patch I uploaded has this fixed, but I could not validate it locally on Mac (I can do it only on Monday).",
