Description:
FreeType library.

Local Modifications:

include/pstables.h: A copy of freetype/src/psnames/pstables.h.  This file is not
part of the public Freetype API, but pdfium needs it.  Since it won't be
avilable when building with the system Freetype, we provide it as a convenience.

0000-include.patch: Modifications to configuration header files.

Most of the updating can be automated will roll-freetype.sh.
