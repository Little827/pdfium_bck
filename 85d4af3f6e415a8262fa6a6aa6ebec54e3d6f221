      "message": "Just as a head-up, the code in this function still relies very much on specifics of the `FT_Face` API, even if the logic moves to CFX_Face, in this file, more work would be needed to move this to Fontations, unless CFX_Face implements a simulation of FT_Face behavior at some point.",

      "message": "Yes, I strongly suspect after this CL chain is done, most FreeType code will be encapsulated, but the way CFX_Face is used is very much based on FreeType-isms. We\u0027ll have to figure out how to work with Fontations and see where the CFX_Face caller can be the same, and where the caller needs two implementations.",
