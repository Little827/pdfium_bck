      "message": "Ah, I see. I did a `git grep CPDF_Annot::Subtype::STAMP`, because redact is quite similar to the already working stamp annotation. Stamp is handled at 4 places:\n\n- PopupAppearsForAnnotType: I missed this, Acrobat\u0027s UI can open a popup for both, so I now added REDACT to the true case, which was missing before.\n\n- the other 3 is something I already covered: conversion between CPDF_Annot::Subtype::REDACT and the Redact string in 2 directions + the static_assert to make sure the API define is in sync with CPDF_Annot::Subtype::REDACT.\n\nPlease let me know if you think there are other places which need adapting.
