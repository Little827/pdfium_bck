I\u0027m guessing in practice almost nobody cares about big-endian, and even fewer care about it for consumer software like pdfium (?)\n\nSince this change came out so nicely (imho), it probably makes sense to also add WideString::FromUTF16(u16string) and implement FromUTF16LE and FromUTF16BE on top of those.",
