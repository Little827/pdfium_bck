      "message": "Thank you for pointing it out!\n\n2 constants (|kBlankPage612By792MD5| and |kHelloWorldOriginalMD5|) in this header file are used under core/ directory. \n\nEven though 3 out of 5 of the constants in this file are used in fpdfsdk directory only, it\u0027s pretty messy to have header file of constants at different level of the directory. I am thinking about adding a header file \"embedder_test_constants.h\" in directory testing/, so that this header can be used for all existing and future PDFium embedder tests (in case more testing PDFs are used for embedder tests in both core/ and fpdfsdk/ in the future).\n\n@thestig @kmoon\nWhat\u0027s your opinion on this plan? If testing/ directory is the place to go, I will go ahead and move this header file there, and add another follow-up CL to consolidate the repetitive hash values in core/ directory.",
