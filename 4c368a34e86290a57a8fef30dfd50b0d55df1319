      "message": "Reworked per our offline discussion (https://crbug.com/pdfium/1878#c24).  Local testing illustrated a couple of missing spots that hadn\u0027t been runtime parameterized, so it fails when a Skia build is run with `--use-renderer\u003dagg`.\n\nThat discovery just holds up a follow-on CL to update the recipes with the extra test run.  I.e., I don\u0027t think it blocks this CL.  The recipes update should be unblocked after https://pdfium-review.googlesource.com/c/pdfium/+/98030 and https://pdfium-review.googlesource.com/c/pdfium/+/98031 land.",
