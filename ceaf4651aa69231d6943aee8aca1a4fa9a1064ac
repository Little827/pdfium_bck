      "message": "The treelist is kind of a mess, since theres a CJX_TreeList backing it that would also have to merge into a CJX_List.  What\u0027s even odder is that there are entries for both Deltas and treeList in the elements.inc file so some part of the parser might recognize those terms.  I didn\u0027t see either of these mentioned in the XFA 3.3 spec I have cached -- but there are appendicies about DOM models in that spec that I don\u0027t have.  Do we know if these appear in the wild?",
