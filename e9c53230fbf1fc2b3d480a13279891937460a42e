      "message": "I\u0027m very surprised a straight-forward rendering of rectangles.pdf fails to be pixel perfect for the |kOriginalMD5| cases. At 300% zoom, I can see some very small differences. Can you? It will be good to at least be able to determine if this difference is an improvement or a regression.",

      "message": "To be clear, what I mean is rendering the image at scale \u003d 100%, then zooming into the rendered image helps see the differences. Rendering rectangles.pdf with pdfium_test using different values for --scale sometimes results in matching rendering between AGG and Skia, and sometimes does not.",

      "message": "Comment #4 in pdfium:1499 (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/pdfium/issues/detail?id\u003d1499#c4) explain the cause of the color discrepancies on the edges of the rectangles, which also explains why as scale goes up, the discrepancy rate drops between AGG\u0027s and Skia\u0027s rendering results.\n\nI also uploaded a simplified test case rect.pdf in comment #5 for debugging the rendering process.\n\nSince the differences line along the thin lines at the edge of the rectangles and it shows as the grey level difference for the test case, it\u0027s hard to say the difference generated by Skia is an improvement or a regression. I think we can consider the rendering results of Skia acceptable since the discrepancy is super minor.",
