      "message": "I\u0027m very surprised a straight-forward rendering of rectangles.pdf fails to be pixel perfect for the |kOriginalMD5| cases. At 300% zoom, I can see some very small differences. Can you? It will be good to at least be able to determine if this difference is an improvement or a regression.",

      "message": "To be clear, what I mean is rendering the image at scale \u003d 100%, then zooming into the rendered image helps see the differences. Rendering rectangles.pdf with pdfium_test using different values for --scale sometimes results in matching rendering between AGG and Skia, and sometimes does not.",
