      "message": "Can we add more tests? There\u0027s a lot of variations to font names. e.g. On one of my computers, I have:\n1) \"Noto Sans Bold\" - family is \"Noto Sans\"\n2) \"NotoSerifTamilSlanted Condensed Black\" - family is \"NotoSerifTamilSlanted\"\n3) \"Oxygen-Sans Sans-Bold\" - family is \"Oxygen-Sans\"\n\nI would like to avoid tweaking the algorithm, which sometimes helps one case, but regresses another. If we have more comprehensive tests, that would make it harder to have regressions.",
