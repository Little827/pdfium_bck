      "message": "I believe the existing code shares this flaw, but I wonder to what extent the parser should degrade gracefully if the code section is not a multiple of 2.\n\nI\u0027m curious if Acrobat has the same behavior, since the use of 001B as both the beginning and ending escape sequence (and using 2-byte codes) would seem to suggest processing in 2-byte units in UTF-16 mode.\n\nI also wondered to what extent we should validate that the codes actually are ASCII, but this shouldn\u0027t matter in the end since 001B cannot be part of a surrogate pair or a multibyte UTF-8 sequence.",
