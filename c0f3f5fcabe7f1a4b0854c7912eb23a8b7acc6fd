There are non-interactable things like draw elements (i.e. arcs, lines, etc) that are widgets, but not form fields, that will return XFA. \n\nI am breaking out the form fields types, so that things like OnMouseLeftDown in Chrome can correctly identify if the widget is a editable text field instead of trying to get the annotation for it, which doesn\u0027t exist for XFA and causes a crash.",
