      "message": "Oddly, this one complained in the other direction, because I think the explicit call to LineRect() in emplace_back was running the LineRect constructor to make a temporary, and then emplace_back was invoking a copy constructor from the temporary, so it said use push back. I suspect that if I were to scan the code again after making this change, it would say use emplace_back. I think the right thing is emplace_back with two args to construct in place.",
