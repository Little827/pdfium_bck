      "message": "Thanks for this addition!\nnit: I don\u0027t like the API\u0027s name `FPDFPage_Move()` since it doesn\u0027t match pdfium conventions. To my understanding, `FPDFPage_*()` functions operate on an individual page handle, but MovePages is actually a document-level operation (FPDF_DOCUMENT, not FPDF_PAGE), so it should rather be called `FPDFDoc_MovePages()` IMHO.\nSince this is a very new API, I think it would still be OK to change.",
