      "message": "I couldn\u0027t find any specific style guide on which is preferred for using-declaration (declare right before use or at the top of the scope), as long as it\u0027s in the smallest scope of where it\u0027s being used. But judging by https://abseil.io/tips/119, it says \"More generally, the closer a declaration is to the point of use, the smaller is the set of scopes that can break your code.\" Maybe putting using-declaration right before use is the preferred way?",
