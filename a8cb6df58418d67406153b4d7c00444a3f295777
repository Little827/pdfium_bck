      "message": "The language that describes /I in PDF 1.7 page 694 and ISO 32000-1:2008 page 445 differ slightly, but they both take an entire paragraph to describe the relationship. I think your summary is over-simplifying it a bit.\n\nGiven the existing code already does not capture everything in the spec, which is non-trivial, it would be too much work for this one CL to get it 100% correct. I think we should save that effort for another time, and focus on doing enough here so we can continue to focus on https://crbug.com/pdfium/1377 and get that fixed. WDYT?",
