      "message": "And yet I\u0027m a bit doubtful if this is going in the right direction.\nWith `FPDFImageObj_GetImageMetadata()` there\u0027s always the problem that it may do more work than the caller actually needs. E. g. if you only want DPI, the other values are calculated unnecessarily.\nMaybe a single API function with flags of possible metadata params to retrieve would be (rsp. have been) better? Like this:\n```C\n#define FPDF_IMGMETA_SIZE 0x01,\n#define FPDF_IMGMETA_DPI 0x02,\n#define FPDF_IMGMETA_BPP 0x04,\n// and so on ...\n\nFPDFImageObj_GetMetadataByFlags(FPDF_PAGEOBJECT image, FPDF_PAGE page,\n                                FPDF_IMAGEOBJ_METADATA* metadata, int flags)\n```\nThen only the params requested by the caller would be set on the metadata object.\nIf further params are needed later, the function may be re-called with the same metadata object.",

      "message": "Agreed my proposal above isn\u0027t elegant. (I guess the problem is unnecessary allocations for unused struct fields, right?)\n\nAnyway, thinking about this again, I guess it\u0027s too much fuss for little advantage.\nHaving a separate API for image size (as added here) is good as it\u0027s a very common operation, but actually I don\u0027t mind much if the other values can only be retrieved as a group.
