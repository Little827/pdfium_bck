      "message": "Optional: Stream is somewhat uninteresting (is just a content stream with inline image data that paints the letter \"A\"). Rather than encode the entire stream as ASCIIHexDecode, however, you can encode just the inline image data (BI/ID/EI operators; see section 8.9.7 of PDF 32000-1), using a \"/F /AHx\" entry in the BI section.\n\nGiven that we don\u0027t really care about the content stream, however, and it doesn\u0027t really shrink this section very much, I wouldn\u0027t worry about it. It\u0027d probably be more beneficial to find a Type 3 font with simpler glyphs.",
