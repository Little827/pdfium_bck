The expected results in this directory can be generated by running application
`pdfium_test` with the option `--font-dir`, which overrides the path to external
fonts. (Run `pdfium_test --help` to see more details of all the options.)

For example, you can test rendering myfile.pdf by running:
`<build_dir>/pdfium_test --font-dir=<source_dir>testing/resources/fonts --png <source_dir>/testing/resources/pixel/use_ahem/myfile.pdf`.
