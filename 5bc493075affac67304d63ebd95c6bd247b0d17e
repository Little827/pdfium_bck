I\u0027m assuming if you got here that you don\u0027t have a builder using Skia on Mac, since the commit previous to this one deleted SkFontHost_mac.cpp .\n\nWe do have a Skia Mac bot: https://ci.chromium.org/p/pdfium/builders/try/mac_skia, which is what alerted me to update skia/BUILD.gn. PDFium\u0027s skia/BUILD.gn, for whatever reason, does not include SkFontHost_mac.cpp for the Mac build. It\u0027s only included for iOS builds, which I will clean up separately.",
