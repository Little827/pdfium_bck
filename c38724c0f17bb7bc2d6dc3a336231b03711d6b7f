      "message": "In my recent CL(https://pdfium-review.googlesource.com/c/pdfium/+/64390) where I was trying to test \"Implementing enter key press over reset button\", Lei have suggested to add embeddertest and pixel test. I understand pixel test is for testing rendering. As we are moving focus over different form control \u0026 press Enter there, we do render inside checkbox/radio buttons and draw dotted lines over the control on moving focus. So I believe this pixel test can be added.\n\nKindly let me know if you have other thoughts or if my understanding is incorrect.",
