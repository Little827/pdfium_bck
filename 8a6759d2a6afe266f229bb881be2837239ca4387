      "message": "The specific value is derived from what I see in the pop up in Acrobat when I click the appropriate element. The equivalent popup in PDFium has \u0027Find 12 items\u0027. Looking at the PDF details, the string is actually \\Find, so we are dropping the \u0027\\\u0027. The number is derived from the length of the list returned by .ResolvedNodes. So either PDFium is returning 12 items, or is returning something else that looks like a list that is 12 elements long, maybe a string? Looking at the code/document, I am pretty sure 1 is the correct value.",

Why doesn\u0027t this say \"Alert: \\Find 1 items\" like other examples of *_expected.txt in the codebase?\n\nI never dealt with these tests, so maybe I\u0027m asking basic things, but without reading test code, I don\u0027t know what this is doing.",

      "message": "The _expected.txt is being compared to logging messages that come out of pdfium_test while it is rendering. The logging messages are primarily information about what dialogues are being shown and things like beeps being fired from JS. It is a log of interesting JS activities. This is instead of having to do some sort of super complex pixel testing where we pause rendering and generate a snap shot at each event or something like that.\n\nThe string that is actually being printed by pdfium_test is \"\u003ctitle\u003e \u003cicon|type\u003e?:\u003cmessage\u003e\". In this case there is no title, icon, or type being set, so it becomes \":\u003cmessage\u003e\". \n\nWhat this test is specifically testing is using .ResolveNodes() to get another node by name, \"x.y.z\" if I recall correctly. There is only one instance of this in the PDF, so I am not exactly sure why it is returning a list of 12 items. I have filed a bug about this and suppressed the test.",
