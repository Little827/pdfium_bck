      "message": "It doesn\u0027t decode (due to the ValidateColorIndex() bug), so I think moving it to page 2 wouldn\u0027t be useful for the purpose of un-suppressing the file.\n\nThis BMP is a red 50x50 square using direct 24-bit color vs. a red 50x50 square using indexed 8-bit color, so not much different there. This BMP also uses the V4 format, but we don\u0027t support the V4 header fields anyway. (The headers are backwards-compatible.) I think these kind of differences are better exercised in the ProgressiveDecoder unit tests.\n\nIt\u0027d probably be more useful to introduce a new 32-bit color test case, as that would exercise a new path in XFA_GetDIBFormat(), but I don\u0027t think it makes sense to do that in this change. (Also, ideally it would exercise the alpha component.)",
