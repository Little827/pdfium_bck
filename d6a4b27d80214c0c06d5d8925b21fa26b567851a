This sounds a bit like 1 character would be counted as 1 value, regardless of whether it takes 2 or 4 bytes.\nBut to my understanding, `buflen` actually is the number of 2-byte pairs, or am I mistaken?\nBecause according to our testing, the implementation with FPDFText_GetBoundedText() continued to work as expected, i.e. `buflen*2` produced the exact number of bytes we have to allocate, as opposed to FPDFText_GetText(), which broke.",
