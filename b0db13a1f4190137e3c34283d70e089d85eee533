      "message": "There is no related bug for this. I accidentally stumbled upon this issue when I created a 2 paths test:\nThe 1st path is filling a zero-area path. \nThe 2nd path is filling a regular triangle path.\n\nWhen DrawPath() is called for the second time (to queue the second path), FlushPath() will try to flush the first path out. This is when m_fillOptions.zero_path \u003d\u003d true (in SkiaState) and m_FillOptions.zero_path \u003d\u003d false (in the driver).\n\nThe logic is very wrong as we should not use the second path\u0027s fill options to draw the first path. But I was having trouble creating a pixel test that can render differently before and after these 3 chained CLs.",
