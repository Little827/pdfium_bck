CJS_Runtime::m_pFormFillEnv is set by the ctor and never modified, apart from self-nulling as an observed ptr (and would be const if it weren\u0027t for this quirk). CJS_EventContext::m_pJSRuntime is in fact const, as could be the CJS_event_recorder that lives next to it. That is the only place event recorders are made.",
