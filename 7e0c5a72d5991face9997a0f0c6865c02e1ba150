      "message": "This fixed run_javascript_tests.py --disable_javascript, but --disable-xfa is still broken. Since you keep running into this gotcha, and you wanted to keep |self.disable_javascript| even though it\u0027s currently redundant, here\u0027s my suggestion on how we can make this all work better:\n\n- Have |self.options.disable_javascript| be what it is, the literal command line switch passed in.\n- Have |self.disable_javascript| represent whether JS is effectively enabled or not.\n- Similar concept for the \"disable_xfa\" variables.\n\nIn which case, |self.options.disable_javascript| set to true would mean self.disable_xfa \u003d true. Go from there and see if that simplifies this CL.",
