(Because sometimes expectations can represent the current behavior instead of correct behavior.)",

That\u0027s why I think it\u0027s best to leave it to the future bug assignee, and not try to guess what the right answer is in this CL.\n\nFor example, one fix that I think would be correct would be to have AGG render images exactly the same size as the special case for axis-aligned rectangles. (This would involve adjustments that could make the images smaller or larger.)\n\nAlso, for Skia, we would need to drop the special case for axis-aligned rectangles.
