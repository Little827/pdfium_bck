      "message": "Yes, that\u0027s why I mentioned in the CL description: \"A future change will simplify SkiaState to eliminate support for lazy flushing, which creates significant extra complexity.\" This change also contains TODOs to get rid of lazy flushing.\n\nIn my research so far, combining paths actually is a pessimization for Skia, as two rectangles combined into a single path can\u0027t be treated as a simple rectangular path anymore (for which Skia has special fast paths). Absent actual evidence this is making anything noticeably slower, I don\u0027t think this is a good reason not to make this change. On the other hand, making this change improves consistency of rendered output, which is a good thing.",

      "message": "A few other thoughts on this topic:\n\n1. If combining paths is a win (although it\u0027s not), we should be doing that in generic PDF code, not in the Skia backend code; AGG and Skia otherwise don\u0027t behave the same (as AGG doesn\u0027t merge paths). Doing it in the Skia backend was a design mistake.\n2. AGG rasterizing immediately and Skia deferring rasterization has been the root cause of a number of AGG-Skia rendering differences (due to missing flushes for Skia). We\u0027ll save maintenance hassle by eliminating lazy flushing.\n3. The combining itself comes at a performance cost, since we need extra memory allocations and bookkeeping to maintain the combining state.",
