      "message": "Two issues so far:\n\n1. buildtools/third_party/libc++/trunk, buildtools/third_party/libc++abi/trunk, and buildtools/third_party/libunwind/trunk are no longer part of the buildtools. I think having their own reversion numbers in pdf/DEPS needs to be done. \n\n2. After rolling to the latest version of buildtools, building pdfium triggers error: \"/bin/sh: line 1: ../../buildtools/linux64/gn: No such file or directory\". In pdfium, the path becomes buildtools/linux64/linux64/gn, therefore the error happens. However, a lot of code in chromium and build repos are still using path buildtools/linux64/gn. I think this might be related to https://crrev.com/c/2743918, which suggest to move gn version into project\u0027s top level DEPS.\n\nNow I am working on a solution that doesn\u0027t remove buildtools as a submodule. Hopefully changing top level DEPS can resolve the issues.",
