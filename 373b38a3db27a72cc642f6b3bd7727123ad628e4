      "message": "|anti_alias|, |bNormal| used to only affect AGG rendering before this CL.\n\nWhen Skia/SkiaPaths is enabled, we only have to consider two cases: conditions at line 871 and line 889, and line 889 is the most generic case here.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCondition line 889: \nWith or without FPDF_LCD_TEXT flag, as long as text is smooth, AGG sets anti aliasing type to LCD by default. And the FPDF_LCD_TEXT only controls variable |bNormal|, which toggles the parameter |bNormal| for DrawNormalTextHelper() and affect how each pixel is calculated when anti-aliasing type is LCD.\n\nHowever, for Skia/Skiapaths, we only have 1 SkFont::Edging type for LCD (unlike AGG has two ways to calculate each pixel when anti-aliasing is LCD). By default, LCD optimization is disabled, and FPDF_LCD_TEXT is meant to strictly control whether anti-aliasing type is LCD. Therefore, we shouldn\u0027t update |text_options| according to AGG\u0027s |anti_alias|\u0027s value.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpecial condition line 871: This CL currently force turn off LCD optimization just like AGG, to get a better rendering result.",
