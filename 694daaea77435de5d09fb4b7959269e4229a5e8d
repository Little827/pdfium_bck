      "message": "I investigated the build failure on macOS, and I believe the cause should be:\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4598450/2/base/allocator/partition_allocator/partition_alloc_base/mac/mac_util.h\nwhere the support of MAC_OS_VERSION_12_0 has been changed from \"optional\" to \"mandatory\".\n\nI\u0027m not good at this area, but it looks to me that Chromium project uses reasonably-up-to-date SDKs and MAC_OS_VERSION_12_0 is always defined.\n\nI see two obvious options here:\n1) PDFium will upgrade Xcode and SDKs to the latest version or enough recent one.\n2) Land a patch in PartitionAlloc so that MAC_OS_VERSION_12_0 will be optional (partial revert of the patch).\n\nI\u0027d personally recommend the option 1) as we might see more issues with old SDKs sooner or later. Also it won\u0027t be good to differ from Chromium build environments.",
