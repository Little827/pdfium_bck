# Config

This directory contains configuration files for chrome-infrastructure services.

For the most part, the actual configs consumed by LUCI live under `generated/`.
Those files are generated by executing the .star files at the root of the
repository.
Don't edit the generated files directly if the configs need to be changed.
Instead, edit the Starlark file and execute it to regenerate the files in
`generated/` directory.

To manually execute the Starlark code, you will need to have `lucicfg` in your
PATH, and run:
```sh
lucicfg generate main.star
```
Or you can execute the .star file directly:
```sh
./main.star
```
