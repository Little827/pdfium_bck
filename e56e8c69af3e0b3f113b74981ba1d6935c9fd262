      "message": "Hi!\n\nI\u0027m trying to evaluate a new clang-tidy warning, and this popped on my radar. You seem to be familiar with this code. :) \n\nDo you happen to know if the intent here was to delete the pointer via `reset()`, or simply `release()` it, since it\u0027ll be freed elsewhere? The check I\u0027m using only complains because it sees that this is unused, so it could be that this code is totally _correct_. It\u0027s just unclear to me, as a reader without great context, whether that\u0027s the case.",
