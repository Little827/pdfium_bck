      "message": "Curious how you select the results to group into a CL. For instance, bug_1161_expected_skia.pdf.0.png is a rectangle missing corners case, which we see often. Why not group all the rectangle renderings into one CL? Similarly, bug_1282_expected_skia.pdf.0.png is a form field color being slightly off case. Why not group all of those into a single CL?",
