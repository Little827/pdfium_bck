      "message": "* Is there a use case? - yes, I hit this on the chromium side where converting a span of uint8_t to one of several types later on -- span of float, span of uint16_t, etc. looks really ugly.  And I wanted to be sure folks didn\u0027t have to manually divide by sizeof(T)\n\n* Should U\u0026T match in constness?  Good idea, will do.\n\n* Should s.size_bytes() mod sizeof(T) \u003d\u003d 0 ? I\u0027d be fine in documenting truncation as the behaviour, esp that we\u0027re not testing alignment neither.",
