      "message": "Did we discuss what values are possible for elements of |p-\u003eMat| ? Assuming the values are not clamped in anyway, the elements can contain MAX_INT. So in the worst case, we get roughly (INT_MAX * max_positive) * 3 \u003e\u003e 14. That fits in a 64-bit int, but |l1| which has to hold the return value, is smaller. So I think we need to do the calculation and clamp (saturate) the output as well.",
