      "message": "This is a bit confusing as this is part of a template, and there are additional variables inside this template. The template itself does not need to have `defines`, which is why I\u0027m pushing against patch set 4. Instead, the source_sets need to have `defines`. It would be less confusing if they each had their own:\n1) The ${target_name}_src source_set already has its own on line 217.\n2) The imple_name source_set below does not have one that is consistently defined.\n\nA way to simplify this problem is to just look at line 223-253 as a standalone build target. Does it make sense to put `defines` outside of the source_set, or within?",
