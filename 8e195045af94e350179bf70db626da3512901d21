      "message": "At first I experimented with changing `isAlphaMask` value/ignoring `isAlphaMask`, which caused regression on rendering bug_1087.pdf. (bug_1087 and the suppressed type3 tests are all mask format. And `isAlphaMask` remain true for all of them.)\n\nBy testing both bug_1087.pdf and all the suppressed type3 pixel tests, only two SkBlendModes can make all these tests render correctly: `SkBlendMode::kSrcATop` and `SkBlendMode::kSrcIn`.\n\nAn overview for all SkBlendMode can be found at [1].\nI feel that the original code using `kSrc` made more sense since it directly put the src bitmap (aka the glyph bitmap) on top of the background, but it led to wrong rendering results. I am still trying to create a case to make using `kSrcATop` and `kSrcIn` lead to different results.\n\n[1] https://skia.org/docs/user/api/skblendmode_overview/",
