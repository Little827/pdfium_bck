      "message": "I find this harder to understand unrolled like this than with a while/switch structure. Specifically, it\u0027s weird that:\n- Some stages cannot repeat themselves because they are inside an if, not a while. If the stage method returns itself, we\u0027ll hit an assert that doesn\u0027t make it clear that it was forbidden.\n- There is no pause after these stages.",
